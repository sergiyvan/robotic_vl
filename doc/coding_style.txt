FUmanoid Coding Style and General Coding Tips
=============================================

Keep It Simple, Stupid!

* Identifiers and comments in English.

* ALL_CAPS for defines: MAX_PITCH_VALUE
* CamelCalse for classes: MyClass
* camelCase for everything else: myLocalVar

* ONE statement per line.
* Indentation with TABS.
* Use newlines to divide code in logical parts.
* Spaces after 'for', 'while', 'if', etc.: "if (x != 1) {"
* Keep lines short (try 80 chars), NOT longer than 120 chars.
* Attach pointer/reference operator (*/&) to the variable type:
 "MyClass& x = ..."

* Use Doxygen comments
  * for classes in the header.
  * for functions where they are implemented, in the *.cpp.

* ONLY declaration in the header, keep it clean.
* Definition in the *.cpp.
* Try to keep includes in the headers to a minimum.

* Use References, no pointers (except if you really have to).
* Use "const" whenever possible.
* Pass objects as const reference:
  "void function(const MyClass& instance) {"

Use the formating option of Eclipse or 'astyle' (see tools/astylerc) to format
your code automatically.
